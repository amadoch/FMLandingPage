## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I understand why we need build the in a mobile screen, I just a lot easier to compose and prioritize the most complex element in your page to make them like approved of screen, And I can see CSS it's no hard is just tedious one becuase part or the time its reading or seeing examples on how the thing work and later how works in the website.

And learned to if do you do have to work in responsive page, work first in small screen.
